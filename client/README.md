# Client Directory

This directory houses all the python code you will use and implement to control the robot in simulation and real life.

# Subdirectory Structure:
- `core`: contains support code we provide to you, such as helper functions and interfaces for interacting with the robot (either simulated or real!)
- `demos`: contains some example scripts, mostly for the instruction team
- `lib`: will contain functions implementing algorithms to solve computational problems relating to the class material, such as forward and inverse kinematics and trajectory planning
- `labs`: will contain test scripts that use the algorithms you implement in `lib` and the tools we provide in `core` to control the robot and achieve tasks

`lib` and `labs` will be the main places you are working this semester!
